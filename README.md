## **Project Purpose & Goal**
The purpose of creating this project was to demonstrate my skills as a web developer. I did this by creating my own personal website that could walk potential employers through my **skills** and **abilities** in a more interactive way. My main goal for creating this website was to become more comfortable with HTML and CSS. In addition to this, I was able to learn a lot more about these technologies and be able to showcase my potential to employers.

## **Technologies Used**
The main technologies used for this project was **HTML** and **CSS** and a little bit of **JavaScript**. Having just completed an online course regarding these topics, I felt that it was a perfect time to create my own personal website. While creating this, I became much more comfortable using HTML and CSS, and learning much more about actually designing a website. I believe this made it much easier for me to implemenet these languages in a much more efficient way.

## **Design & Thought Process**
Before designing this website, I wanted the user to have a very easy time navigating the website. To do this, I implemented a sticky navigation bar at the top that follows the user as he/she scrolls down the page. This allows the user to be able to jump to different sections of the page very easily.

In addition to this, I wanted the website to be **interactive and fun to use**. To do this, I implemented very user friendly links, such as the navigation bar. In addition to this, I created a carousel component that could display my various projects I have been working on. This component was done using JavaScript, and helped me become more comfortable with this programming language.

As far as the overall design of this website, I mainly wanted to include **5 different sections**. These include the home page, about page, social page, portfolio page, and finally the contact page. The home page would simply introduce myself, and allow the user to be able to download my resume. From here, the about page will briefly talk about myself and my passion for web development, and also list my various skills I have. After this, the socials section quickly introduces ways to connect with me via Linkedin, Facebook, and GitHub. Next, the featured projects page would simply allow the user to view specific projects that I have created over the past few months. Finally, the contact page allows the user to contact me through a forum in order to discuss further with me regarding potential career opportunities.
