        <p class="main-sub">This website was created in order to showcase my skills as a web developer. I created this
            in order to become more comfortable with HTML and CSS, while also providing a way for employers to see my

        <h2>Project Purpose & Goal</h2>
        <p class="description">The purpose of creating this project was to demonstrate my skills as a web developer. I
            did this by creating
            my
            own personal website that could walk potential employers through my <strong>skills</strong> and
            <strong>abilities</strong> in
            a more
            interactive way.
            This being one of my first actual websites, my main goal was to become more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
            In addition to this,
            I was able to learn a lot more about these technologies and be able to showcase my potential to employers.
        </p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p class="description">The main technologies used for this project was <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong>CSS.</strong> Having just completed an
            online course
            regarding these topics, I felt that it was a perfect time to create my own personal website. While creating
            this, I became much more comfortable using HTML and CSS, and learning much more about actually designing a
            website. I believe this made it much easier for me to implemenet these languages in a much more efficient
            way.
        </p>

        <h2>Design & Thought Process</h2>
        <p class="description">Before designing this website, I wanted the user to have a very easy time navigating the
            website.
            To do this, I implemented a navigation bar at the top, and also an arrow that follows the user as he/she
            scrolls down the page.
            This allows the user to be able to jump to the top of the page, or specific sections very easily.
        </p>
        <p class="description">In addition to this, I wanted the website to be <strong>interactive and fun to
                use.</strong> To do this, I
            implemented hover effects
            on some of my elements in order to make the page feel more interactive.
        </p>
        <p class="description">As far as the overall design of this website, I mainly wanted to include <strong>5
                different
                sections.</strong>
            These include the home page, about page, skills page, portfolio page, and finally the contact page. The home
            page would
            simply introduce myself, and allow the user to be able to download my resume. From here, the about page will
            briefly talk
            about myself and my passion for web development. After this, the skills section lists the different skills I
            have gained
            throughout my college education and my further studies into web development. Next, the featured projects
            page would simply
            allow the user to view specific projects that I have created over the past few months. Finally, the contact
            page allows the user
            to contact me through a forum in order to discuss further with me regarding potential career opportunities.
